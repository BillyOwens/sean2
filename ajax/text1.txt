Treating burns

To treat a burn, follow the first aid advice below. 

    Take immediate action to stop the burning process - for example, by getting the person away from the fire.
    Remove any clothing or jewellery that is near the burnt area of skin but do not remove anything that is stuck to the burnt skin.
    Cool the burn with cool or lukewarm water for 10 to 30 minutes. Do not use ice, iced water or any creams or greasy substances, such as butter.
    Make sure that the person keeps warm - for example using a blanket, but take care to avoid rubbing it against the burnt area.
    Cover the burn by placing a layer of cling film over it.
    Use painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen, to treat the pain of a burn.

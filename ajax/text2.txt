Cuts and grazes are some of the most common injuries.

Minor cuts and grazes (where only the surface layer of skin is cut or scraped off) may bleed and feel slightly painful, but the affected area will normally scab over and heal quickly.

However, if the cut is in an area that is constantly moving, such as your knee joint, it may take longer to heal.

Depending on how deep the cut is and where it is on your body, a scar may remain once the cut has healed.

Deeper cuts may damage important structures below the skin, such as nerves, blood vessels or tendons. Grazes that remove the deeper layers of skin are rare.

Most cuts and grazes can be easily treated at home. More severe cases may need medical attention, such as stitches to close the wound.

When to seek medical help

Seek medical help if any of the below apply:

You think you have damaged deeper tissues: signs include numbness (indicating injury to a nerve), blood spurting from the wound or bleeding that does not stop after five minutes of continuous firm pressure.
The wound is at risk of becoming infected: for example, a cut has been contaminated with soil, faeces or a dirty blade, or fragments of material (such as grit or glass) can be seen in the wound.
The wound has become infected: signs include swelling of the affected area, pus coming from the wound, redness spreading from the wound and increasing pain from the wound.
The wound cannot be closed with a plaster, or it starts to open up when you move.
The wound will create an unwelcome scar: for example, if it occurs on a prominent part of your face.
